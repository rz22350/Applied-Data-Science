2025.3.5 CNN_Applied_DS.py This file is a custom CNN model, which contains data enhancement, moving out the background of the image, etc., but the accuracy is 0 after training, there should be some bugs

MobilenetV2_DS.py This file is using mobilenetV2 as a model to replace the custom CNN model, the rest of the content is the same as 2025.3.5 CNN_Applied_DS.py, but there is no time to train it yet, I don't know if there is a problem or not
